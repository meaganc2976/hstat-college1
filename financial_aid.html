                     <h2 class="intro-text">Completing the FAFSA</h2><HR>
                        <p class="infor">
                    I. Everyone should complete the FAFSA (Free Application for Federal Student Aid) online. *The only people who should not apply are students who are undocumented. <br><br>
                    II. The FAFSA (Free Application for Financial Aid) form must be completed online. The FAFSA
                    website is Here *Beware websites that charge you to complete the application. You should complete the application for 2017-2018. You should complete the FAFSA as soon after October 1st as possible using your parents' 2015 taxes. <br><br>
                    III.
                    In order to apply for FAFSA online, parents and students will both need FSAIDs (formerly known as PINs). This will serve as your online signature once you complete the application. You must get your FSA ID before filling out the FAFSA.
                    You will need both your social security number and your parent's social security number to get FSA IDs. Click here for the FSA ID website. *If you parents do not have a Social Security number, they will not make an ID. Instead, you
                    will be prompted to print a signature page to be mailed in once you complete the FAFSA.* <br><br>
                    IV. Worksheets to help you through the process are available here: https://fafsa.ed.gov/help/ffdef44.htm <br><br>
                    V. As the funds for financial aid are
                    finite, it is best to complete this application as soon as possible. <br><br>
                    VI. You can only list 10 schools at a time on the FAFSA. There are two ways to handle this issue: <br> 1) Put in your first 10, and wait for the confirmation email containing
                    your SAR. Then, call each school's financial aid office to confirm that they've received it. Once a school has received it, you can erase them from your FAFSA and enter the code for another school to send again. <br> 2) Put in your first
                    10 schools, and wait for your SAR, which will contain your DRN (your data release number). You can call the schools you were unable to list and provide them with your DRN. They may be able to access your FAFSA that way.

                    <p class="infor">
                    TAP Tuition Assistance Program for students attending college in New York State <br><br>
                    I. After completing the FAFSA, students who applied to schools in New York State must complete the TAP Application. <br><br>
                    II. The NYS Higher Education Services
                    Corporation website also has clear definitions of the types of grants, loans, and scholarships available to students:https://www.hesc.ny.gov/pay-for-college/financial-aid/types-of-financial-aid.html <br><br>
                    III. You can only choose one NY
                    school to list on the TAP. Once you decide on the NY school you will attend in the fall, you can go back in to TAP and make the change, if necessary. </p><br>
                    <h2 class="intro-text"> Completing the CSS profile </h2><HR> 
                    <p class="infor">
                    I. Many, not all, schools require that you also complete
                    a CSS profile in addition to the FAFSA. CUNY and SUNY do not. You should complete the application for 2017-2018. Click here to see the list of schols that require the CSS profile. <br><br>
                    II. Those schools that require the CSS profile are
                    very strict about the deadlines for its submission. <br><br>
                    III. There is a $25 fee for the initial application and a $16 fee for each school report. Click here to learn about CSS profile fee waivers. <br><br>
                    IV. The CSS Profile website is: https://profileonline.collegeboard.com/prf/index.jsp

                    What does Net Price mean? Net Price is the amount that a student pays to attend an institution in a single academic year
                    AFTER subtracting scholarships and grants the student receives. Scholarships and grants are forms of financial aid that a student does not have to pay back. <br><br>
                    What is a Net Price Calculator? Net price calculators are available on a college's
                    or university's website and allow prospective students to enter information about themselves to find out what students like them paid to attend the institution in the previous year, after taking grants and scholarships into account.<br><br>
